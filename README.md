Lunar Lander - B4X

This is a remake of the old awesome Lunar Lander Game from the 80s.
It is written in B4x (B4j) and can be easily ported to Android and iOS.
It includes also a Camera Zoom feature like the original game.

Have fun playing this game and explore the code. For any question you can go to www.b4x.com

You can read a little bit about the game on Wikipedia:

WIKIPEDIA - Gameplay

Lunar Lander is a single-player game in the Lunar Lander subgenre in which the player attempts to land a lunar landing module on the Moon. The game is displayed using black and white vector graphics and depicts a side-on view of the terrain and the landing module. At the top of the screen, the player is given information on the module's speed, altitude, and fuel, along with the score and time spent in the game. The terrain is jagged and has only a few flat areas appropriate for landing. The player controls the orientation of the module and fires the thruster to steer the module safely to a landing area. The module is always displayed in the center of the screen, with the terrain scrolling beneath it as it travels horizontally, wrapping the single screen-width of terrain endlessly.[1]
